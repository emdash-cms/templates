# EmDash Starter Template (Cloudflare)

A general-purpose starting point for building sites with [EmDash](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash) on Cloudflare Workers. Includes posts, pages, categories, and tags with minimal styling -- designed as a base you can build on rather than a finished theme.
